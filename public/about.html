<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Darija. I'm an academic linguist with a passion for content creation. I started out as a content writer for a content marketing agency in Belgrade, Serbia. Now I'm a freelance content writer and an aspiring web developer.</p>

<p>I first became interested in web design and development a few years back when I created a website for my family's private business. I spent hours watching YouTube Elementor tutorials and applied what I learned on the go. I soon realized I want to do more than follow tutorials and repeat the steps. I want to create stunning, responsive websites as a developer.</p>

<p>Now I'm learning from one of the best web developers and have support of my developer friends. I'm passionate about this field and am eager to see where this web development bootcamp will get me.</p>

<h1>The Best Movies According to Darija</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Titanic is one of the greatest movies of all times. It's also the movie I have seen multiple times as a child. Here's a short rhyme about Titanic: 
    <br /> 
    <br />
The greatest of all <br />
Titanic has sailed <br />
With everyone on board <br />
Tragedy has prevailed</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Even though I've only seen LOTR as a child, I still remember it as one of the best movies.</p>

<h3>Man on Fire</h3>
<p>Again, this is my favorite childhood movie with so much emotion and great acting.</p>
